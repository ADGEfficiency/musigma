# Proposals

### [More Causal Inference with Graphical Models in R Package pcalg (Kalisch, M., Mächler, M., Colombo, D., Hauser, A., Maathuis, M. H., & Bühlmann, P., 2014)](https://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/CRAN/web/packages/pcalg/vignettes/pcalgDoc.pdf)

In this package, some Causal Search Algorithms are implemented. They give a short introduction on the Methodology, and then discuss the different algorithms in more detail.
I would propose reading the first 2 paragraphs (12 pages) for the first meeting, which is the methodological introduction.
Then, if we want to dive in further, we could read the rest for the next meeting and try it practically.

### [A Visual Exploration of Gaussian Processes (Görtler, Kehlbeck, Deussen, 2019)](https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/)

Gaussian processes are essential as a tool in modelling. Deepening the understanding may prove to be extraordinarily usefull beyond their application in regression. Distill is a journal that is famous for their didactive style. This paper allows interactive exploration and experimentation, which makes it ideal for a first introduction.

### [A Short Introduction to Model Selection, Kolmogorov Complexity and Minimum Description Length (MDL) (Nannen, 2003)](http://volker.nannen.com/pdf/short_introduction_to_model_selection.pdf)

This paper describes an interesting and to me very apealing perspective on model selection. To me model selection lies at the heart of good modelling, both in science and industrie. I think it is therfore of greatest interest to our group to extend the theoretical foundations of model selection. This paper is understandable and covers a wide range of historical aproaches, with a good balance between providing details and a big overview.
