Gaussian processes are essential as a tool in modelling. Deepening the understanding may prove to be extraordinarily usefull beyond their application in regression. Distill is a journal that is famous for their didactive style. This paper allows interactive exploration and experimentation, which makes it ideal for a first introduction.
